When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we have multiple people collaborating on the same code from different places.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It is possible that we don't want the new changes added by some other collaborator and continue to work on our current verison.
