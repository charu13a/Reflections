When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we have multiple people collaborating on the same code from different places.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It is possible that we don't want the new changes added by some other collaborator and continue to work on our current verison.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks and clones create a new repository while branch create a diversion in an existing repository. fork is created on github while copying a repository while clone is created when copying repository on local machine or from github to local machine.
fork: to contribute to code you don't have collaboration rights to
clone: to edit code, we need to transfer the files on our computer
branch: to create alternate verisons of same code
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If we are working offline, we can use git diff to see how much we have divereged from the previous version and we can run git status to see if our version is out of sync/ahead/behind or up to date with the remote version.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
We could collaborate by breaking the task into functions and putting all the functions together in the end. Modifications required could be communicated via email and we could host the files on a server such as google drive which would contain the master version.
